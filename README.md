# A Managemant README for Robert Postill
## Introduction
Hi, you may have noticed the trend towards manager READMEs.  After reading [this Hackernoon article](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) I decided I should take the plunge and do the same.  That's becuase I have noticed:
* Over time I have become less available.  That has resulted in me needing to help people understand me who don't spend large chunks of time with me.
* As part of my leadership journey I have started to note that I need to make sure it's clear how to make me do better for you.

## A bit about me
I am a number of things:
* I am loud.  For instance most people will tell you they know where I am by my laugh.  Not everyone loves it.  If you feel like it's too much let me know and I'll work to be respectful of your wishes.
* Speaking of that laugh, it's a blessing and a curse.  But it is an indicator that I have a lot of fun at work, that fun is based upon the belief I am doing one of the best jobs in the world.  I hope that you share that fun with me.
* I love a story.  Not just the latest way I've made a fool of myself but also I look at our industry and try to distill the wisdom from our stories.  My [goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1453968-robert-postill) gives some hint as to the depth of my problem with stories :)
* I love explaining things.  A whiteboard and some markers and I will explain anything I can to you.
* I'm a yes by default.  If I say no it's gerneally with a grimace.
* I'd like to see a fairer world.  I am open to ways to extend our work for others benefit.

You will also notice I have a strong accent and I use what others call Rob-isms.  Which is to say that I often use phrases that are uncommon.  It's not a problem if you need me to repeat something or rephrase it, I'm used to it :)

## Things I should be doing for you
Here is an ordered default list of my priorities:
1. I should be taking [GreenSync](https://greensync.com) to meet it's mission
2. I should be making your team better
3. I should be taking you higher
4. I should be improving myself

In terms of that order some things trump that order.  We'll discuss them when we hit them.  But if everything's working then my belief is that if I work on item 4 it generally has positive impacts on items 3, 2 and 1.  Similarly working on you (item 3) has a positive impact on items 4, 2 and 1.  So while I'm motivated to drive the greatest good for the greatest number I think that starts with getting the best out of me and you.

## Things you should be doing for me
The first thing you need to give me is feedback.  There is no point in me going along thinking everything is fine if there's a problem.  Also a big part of my job is understanding what is concerning you.  You are my eyes and ears in this organisation.  So tell me what you see, good and bad.  Also tell me where I'm going wrong.

After that it's about doing the best job you can.  So that means live the values, try hard and always improve.  At some point things are going to go wrong so when that happens be honest.  If you've made a mistake I'd rather know than not know.  The only way anything gets fixed is with transparency.

## Getting in touch with me
If you're trying to get hold of me start with my claendar.  I don't spend a lot of time at my desk but if I'm not in a meeting you've got a fair chance of finding me there.  I love face to face communication and it's the highest bandwidth approach to getting me a message.

After that try the phone or slack.  Do be aware that I turn on do not disturb after hours.  I try respond in hours, but I can't always garauntee an immediate response.

I check email a couple of times a day but reserve replies for the end of the day or after hours.  Try and reserve this for things you want me to mull over or information updates.

## One on one time
I pulled this from [Scott Burn's README](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PE2OmkVykdZYF2QzmJ-ZUHqBAxnnsbnMsd19z3qLWNI/edit#slide=id.g326aa7ae8d_0_203):
> These meetings are designed to give you a dedicated time and place to ask anything and everything.
> * Hopefully we talk about things you wouldn’t otherwise bring up in a group setting. I want our 1:1 to be a safe place; if this isn’t the case please tell my boss.
> * We will go through your agenda first and if time permits I will always have some questions. First and foremost these meetings are for you.
> * Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1.

Now I'm not so sure about that second point.  I certainly think it's great if you have an agenda but I know that's full on if you aren't explicitly preparing.  So in general I use a simple format and if you want to innovate I'm good with that.  My framework is simple:
1. How are you going?  Tell me about what's happening with you.  This is a good opportunity to discuss professional development.
2. How's your team going?  This gives me a view into where you think your collegaues are and how your work in progressing.  It's a great time to highlight people's achievements that I might have missed.
3. How am I going?  This is your opportunity to give me feedback.  What am I doing wrong?  What am I missing? What else could I be diong to support you and the team?

## Understanding my concerns
I generally have a few things swimming around in my brain at any one time so if you want to get a rough lay of the land start at the What's Rob Thinking About Wall.
![what's rob thinking about wall ](https://github.com/robertpostill/management-readme/raw/master/images/whats_rob_thinking_about.jpg "My wall in May 2018")
Matters that address the contents of that wall are likely to be well received but also if something important is missing please do tell me.

## Understanding where I am with you and where you are with me
Taking this from [Welcome to Netflix and Me](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/edit#slide=id.g3086af6854_0_173)

> In my head, every person reporting to me is in one of three particular levels of performance at any given point:
> * Green: You may have things you want to improve, there may be things I want you to improve, but if you changed nothing, given our current requirements I'd be delighted if you continued to work here for as long as you wanted
> * Orange: There's something you're doing that, long-term, makes your current trajectory unsustainable.  This, if not changed, will not end well.  You'll need to change something
> * Red: Your trajectory is unsustainable on a short-term and there's a specific, concrete, timebox we'll be putting around changing it, and you and I have had an explicit conversation around what's wrong and what the timeline for fixing it is.
> I might realize in hindsight that you're not actually green but orange, but red is never a hindsight realization.  It also means that the answer to the question "am I red right now?" is "if you have to ask, the answer is no".

This seems correct.  I am thinking of changing the names so colour-blind people don't sigh when they hear it.  Other than that you can ask me straight up where you are and I'll give you the whay and what.
