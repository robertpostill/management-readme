# A Managemant README for Robert Postill
## Introduction
Hi, you may have noticed the trend towards manager READMEs.  After reading [this Hackernoon article](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe) I decided I should take the plunge and do the same.  That's becuase I have noticed:
* Over time I have become less available.  That has resulted in me needing to help people understand me who don't spend large chunks of time with me.
* As part of my leadership journey I have started to note that I need to make sure it's clear how to make me do better for you.

## A bit about me
I am a number of things:
* I am loud.  For instance most people will tell you they know where I am by my laugh.  Not everyone loves it.  If you feel like it's too much let me know and I'll work to find better ways with you.
* Speaking of that laugh, it's a blessing and a curse.  But it is an indicator that I have a lot of fun at work, that fun is based upon the belief I am doing one of the best jobs in the world.
* I love a story.  Not just the latest way I've made a fool of myself but also I look at our industry and try to distill the wisdom from our stories.  My [goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1453968-robert-postill) gives some hint as to the depth of my problem with stories :)
* I'm a computer language fan boy. I think programming languages constrain and unlock vast quantities of our potential in computing.
* I love explaining things.  A whiteboard and some markers and I will explain anything I can to you.
* I'm a yes by default.  If I say no it's gerneally with a grimace.
* I'd like to see a fairer world.  I have to accept that I come with big bags of priviledge but that doesn't mean I want the world to stay that way.

You will also notice I have a strong accent and I use what others call Rob-isms.  Which is to say that I often use phrases that are uncommon.  It's not a problem if you need me to repeat something or rephrase it.  There are no stupid questions.

## Things I should be doing for you
Here is an ordered default list of my priorities:
1. I should be taking [GreenSync](https://greensync.com) to meet it's mission
2. I should be making your team better
3. I should be taking you higher
4. I should be improving myself

In terms of that order some things trump that order.  We'll discuss them when we hit them.  My belief is that if I work on item 4 it generally has positive impacts on items 3,2 and 1.  So while I'm bothered about the greatest good for the grreatest number I think that starts with getting the best out of you.

## Things you should be doing for me

I pulled this from [Scott Burn's README](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1PE2OmkVykdZYF2QzmJ-ZUHqBAxnnsbnMsd19z3qLWNI/edit#slide=id.g326aa7ae8d_0_203):
> These meetings are designed to give you a dedicated time and place to ask anything and everything.
> * Hopefully we talk about things you wouldn’t otherwise bring up in a group setting. I want our 1:1 to be a safe place; if this isn’t the case please tell my boss.
> * We will go through your agenda first and if time permits I will always have some questions. First and foremost these meetings are for you.
> * Urgent matters should not wait for a 1:1.

## Understanding where I am with you and where you are with me
Taking this from [Welcome to Netflix and Me](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TPSwdqDqVfWG9anfiOjGUjk0k6zQDij5xPvatPg7NFE/edit#slide=id.g3086af6854_0_173)

> In my head, every person reporting to me is in one of three particular levels of performance at any given point:
> * Green: You may have things you want to improve, there may be things I want you to improve, but if you changed nothing, given our current requirements I'd be delighted if you continued to work here for as long as you wanted
> * Orange: There's something you're doing that, long-term, makes your current trajectory unsustainable.  This, if not changed, will not end well.  You'll need to change something
> * Red: Your trajectory is unsustainable on a short-term and there's a specific, concrete, timebox we'll be putting around changing it, and you and I have had an explicit conversation around what's wrong and what the timeline for fixing it is.
> I might realize in hindsight that you're not actually green but orange, but red is never a hindsight realization.  It also means that the answer to the question "am I red right now?" is "if you have to ask, the answer is no".

This seems correct.  I am thinking of changing the names so colour-blind people don't sigh when they hear it.  Other than that you can ask me straight up where you are and I'll give you the whay and what.
